## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r data echo=TRUE, cache=TRUE}
unzip("activity.zip", exdir = "./data")
activity <- read.csv("./data/activity.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
activity$date <- as.Date(activity$date, format = "%Y-%m-%d")
```



## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r mean echo=TRUE, cache=TRUE}
library(dplyr)
steps.day <- activity %>% 
  group_by(date) %>%
  summarise(total = sum(steps, na.rm = TRUE))
```


## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
